1) IDA syntax is different from Keystone syntax, so before compiling the input
code, Keypatch always try to convert IDA syntax to Keystone syntax. This is not
complete yet, so sometimes you see code that Keypatch cannot compile.
See function fix_ida_syntax() for further details.

2) Some architectures such as X86, ARM & ARM64 are better tested than the rest.
Need more tests for Hexagon, Mips, PPC, Sparc & SystemZ.
